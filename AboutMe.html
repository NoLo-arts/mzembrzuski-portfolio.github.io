                <p>Hello there! My name is <b>Mikołaj Zembrzuski</b> (aka "NoLo"), right now I'm 20 and I'm studying
                    Business Informatics at the University of Economics in Wrocław, Poland.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>For over a decade, my primary passion has been <b>graphic design and art</b> as a whole. I've
                    explored many creative avenues, including filmmaking, photography, drawing, and graphic design.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>At the moment, I'm working on shifting my perspective and attitude toward creating art.<i> I even
                        feel like I'm making art right now, while coding this website</i>. I'm focusing on
                    experimenting, exploring new ideas, and rediscovering that sense of <b>childlike curiosity</b>.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>I enjoy doing <b>personal artistic work</b> as well as <b>commercial orders</b> from various clients.
                    I think both cases are exceptionally interesting and I am looking forward to improving my skills in
                    both areas.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>I've been posting my work on Intagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nolo_arts/">@nolo_arts</a>
                    since 2018. It's been a journey with many different strategies and approaches. In the end, I'm not
                    really happy with the results. Now, I don't take it as seriously as I used to. There were times when
                    I experienced satisfying growth, but it didn't last too long, and younger me got disappointed too
                    often. I think that posting on Instagram affected my art in a bad way because I started focusing too
                    much on numbers. Maybe one day I will get back to it, with more chill attitude and fresher view.</p>

                <h2>Some of my recent achievements:</h2>
                <br>
                <p>In April 2024 - My team and I won the 3rd edition of <b>Samsung's Solve For Tomorrow </b>
                    competition, where we created a project called <b>"Akademic."</b>.It was an app which would help
                    with finding a perfect-fitting roommate for students. It was a great experience and I really learned
                    a lot. I was mainly responsible for the <a href="Gallery.html"><b>graphic design.</b></a> <a
                        href="https://news.samsung.com/pl/ci-uczniowie-stworzyli-aplikacje-ktory-ulatwi-znalezienie-wspollokatora-znamy-zwyciezcow-iii-edycji-solve-for-tomorrow">(Article
                        about us)</a></p>
                        <br>
                <p>In 2022 - I made my <b>own collection</b> called <i>"PEOPLE"</i>, it included 6 simplified
                    illustrations of everyday people. I made prints for an art fair and I think it turned out pretty
                    well in terms of profits and experience.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>In August 2024 - I designed a <b>logo and t-shirts</b> for a band (<a
                        href="https://www.instagram.com/zespol_parter_/">@zespol_parter_</a>). I made a few different
                    version, mockups and I stayed in close contact with the client throughout the design process.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>In November 2022 - I made a <a href="Gallery.html"><b>promotional poster</b></a> for the annual art
                    review vernissage at our local cultural center. It was a fun request and I was playing with
                    composition a lot.</p>

                <p>At the end I just wanted to talk a bit about my personal life and my past. I grew up in Ostrów
                    Wielkopolski, I
                    feel a really strong attachement to this place and I've made many great memories in this city.
                    I wasn't raised in artistic family, but I think it's been a <i>good thing</i>, because
                    there wasn't any external influence on my attitude toward art. I developed it fully by myself
                    throughout the years.</p>
                <br>
                <p>When I was growing up I was perceived as <i>"the gifted kid"</i>, which at that time really
                    motivated me. Years have passed and I don't feel like that anymore and I belive that it had
                    great impact on me. Subconsciously, I am striving to come back to my old <i>"greatness"</i>, back
                    when I was always thinking big (at least it is what I remember). Right now, I am focusing on
                    changing my mindset, breaking free from my old self and finding new paths. I think I am
                    getting there slowly...</p>
                <br>
                <p>Lets say that I've always been an artsy kid, but I really started getting into drawing when I was
                    around 11 years old. At that time I was playing a lot of games, but I loved only, which was
                    <i>"Undertale"</i>. I started to redraw almost every character from it. This was when something
                    "clicked" in me. I started to really like my drawings, I wanted to be better at it, so I began
                    watching Youtube videos, and my skills skyrocketed. I'd say it was my beginning and you probably
                    wouldn't be browsing my website if I hadn't discovered Undertale.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Other than Undertale I also surrounded myself with all kinds creative works. I am a big
                    enjoyer of animation, especially the 2D one. Eastern animation is my personal favorite, because
                    of its dynamic and sometimes flashy movements, also freedom and generally - bold ideas
                    and wild designs. Movies like "Akira", "Spirited Away" or "Tekkonkinkreet" strongly shaped my sense
                    of aesthetics. I highly recommend all of them. Music is a big thing for me as well.<i>I do
                        everything with music</i>.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Summarizing, I think my childhood was great, thanks to people, the place and my many different
                    hobbies which I always picked. I still romanticize about that era and it keeps me inspired.
                    Thank you for your attention.</p>
